summary:  The final project for ICS 314.  Our group designed a website called AthletiCheck, focused on centralizing student athletes' information.
---

For the final project in ICS 314, we were supposed to create a website that demonstrated our knowledge of both front-end and back-end web development using Meteor and Semantic React in IntelliJ.  Our project was AthletiCheck, a website designed to provide easy access to athlete profiles for both the athlete and the trainer, create a single location for all of an athlete's annotated visits with their trainers, and allow for commenting on specific trainer visits.  We used the [meteor-application-template-react](https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template-react/) template to create the website, and Digital Ocean to [deploy the website](https://athleticheck.xyz/).  

My role in the project was to complete the pages assigned to me, as well as organize the big-picture back-end framework, making sure my group members were able to seamlessly get the back-end of their pages working.  More specifically, I was in charge of making the Athlete Profile Page, Admin Athlete Profile Page, and the Edit Profile page, both front-end and back-end (see pictures below).  I also worked on the publication methods and definitions of all of the collections for our database.  I really enjoyed this role, as it provided me with the type of hands-on experience that forces you to learn and understand the content instead of just copying what was taught in class.  I feel like this project helped me genuinely understand the tech stack used in this class.  I developed the technical understanding to have the confidence to know how to approach any issues we came across and find a reasonable solution for it.  This project also provided me with a great opportunity to actually practice collaborative software development through idea-driven project management and version control.  As discussed in [this](https://robert-lemon-uhm.github.io/essays/2020-12-17.html) essay, I believe these skills will last me throughout my coding career.
