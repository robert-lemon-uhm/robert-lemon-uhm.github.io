## The importance of smart questions
With a wide variety of programming languages, platforms, IDEs, and software to choose from, computer science is an incredibly broad discipline.  On top of the ever-expanding amount of content, most developer tools are constantly updating and evolving.  This results in the inevitable problem of getting stuck and not knowing what’s wrong with your code or how to properly implement your ideas.  Because of this, a programmer’s ability to ask smart questions is one of their most important assets.  

## What makes a question ‘smart’?
While there are many ways to word your question, some ways are more likely to get a response than others.  By being able to convey a clear, concise question that shows you researched the problem prior to asking for help, you are much more likely to get a useful response.  

[This question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63835584/using-python-how-do-i-split-on-multiple-delimiters-and-keep-only-one-in-my-outp) on Stack Overflow provides an excellent example of a smart question that yielded useful results.

The title quickly conveys the user’s question:
```
Using Python, how do I split on multiple delimiters and keep only one in my 
output list?
```

They then go into more detail
```
a very green python user here, so go easy on me and the docs haven't helped me 
understand what I'm missing. Similar to “RE split multiple arguments | (or) returns 
none python”, I need to split a string on multiple delimiters. The above question 
only allows either keeping none or keeping both delimiters - I need to keep only 
one of them. Note that the above question was from 2012, so likely a much earlier 
version of Python that 3.6, which I'm using
```

They provide a link to the other StackOverflow question they referenced, showing that research was put into their current question.

After stating their question, they provide an example of their data, desired outcome, current implementation, and a couple methods that they already tried.  They end the post by stating what they think the problem is related to and thanking the forum users for their help.
