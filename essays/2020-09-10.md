## The importance of smart questions
With a wide variety of programming languages, platforms, IDEs, and software to choose from, computer science is an incredibly broad discipline.  On top of the ever-expanding amount of content, most developer tools are constantly updating and evolving.  This results in the inevitable problem of getting stuck and not knowing what’s wrong with your code or how to properly implement your ideas.  Because of this, a programmer’s ability to ask smart questions is one of their most important assets.  

## What makes a question ‘smart’?
While there are many ways to word your question, some ways are more likely to get a response than others.  By being able to convey a clear, concise question that shows you researched the problem prior to asking for help, you are much more likely to get a useful response.  

[This question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63835584/using-python-how-do-i-split-on-multiple-delimiters-and-keep-only-one-in-my-outp) on Stack Overflow provides an excellent example of a smart question that yielded useful results.
