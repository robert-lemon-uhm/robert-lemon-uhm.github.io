## A Simpler Time
When I enrolled in Software Engineering, I was looking forward to undertaking the always-challenging task learning new software, frameworks, and programming languages.  I knew the course dealt with web development, but aside from that, I was going into it blind.  Fortunately for me, I found my footing in this completely new environment pretty quickly, thoroughly enjoying the exposure to such a new style of programming compared to my background in lower-level development.  The concept of functional programming caught me by surprise, seeming so complex and unfamiliar, yet so incredibly intuitive and straightforward (at least, the very basics that we have been exposed to so far).  After becoming familiar with the functional language of Javascript, HTML and CSS seemed like a natural progression for software engineering.  These first five or six weeks of class definitely had a learning curve, but I finally started to develop a decent understanding of the style and content of the course.  And then UI Frameworks were introduced.
